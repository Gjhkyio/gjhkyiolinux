				<h1>HOWTO: Build your own Puppy using Woof-CE</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			Woof-CE is the tool to build Puppies, including the one you're using right now! This page will walk you through how to build and customize a Puppy.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, you need at least 10 gigabytes of free storage and your Puppy's devx SFS. How to get the latter is explained <a href="devx.htm">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Open a terminal, and let's get going!
		</p>
		<section>
			<h2>Building</h2>
			<h3>Step 1: Clone Woof-CE</h3>
			<p>
				Run the command <code>git clone https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE.git</code> to clone (download) Woof-CE to your computer.
			</p>

			<h3>Step 2: Run merge2out</h3>
			<p>
				Run the command <code>./merge2out</code> and follow the prompts.
				Choose the target architecture of your Puppy, the Linux distro whose packages will be used, and which version of the distro to use.
			</p>

			<h3>Step 3: Build your Puppy!</h3>
			<p>
				Run the command <code>cd ../woof-out_*</code> to go to the newly created directory, and then just run the following commands in order!
				<code>./0setup</code>
				<code>./1download</code>
				<code>./2createpackages</code>
				<code>./3builddistro</code>
				If everything went well, you should have a brand new Puppy .iso file in the directory! Congratulations!

			<h2>Customizing</h2>
			<p>
				Now, this is great and all, but what if you want to customize your Puppy? Well, that's what this section is about.
			</p>
			<p>
				The files we'll be talking about here are DISTRO_SPECS, DISTRO_PKGS_SPECS, and _00build.conf.
			</p>
			<h3>DISTRO_SPECS</h3>
			<p>
				DISTRO_SPECS is the file that specifies the name of the Puppy, its version number, the compatible distro, among other things.
				If you've already used merge2out, the only relevant variables are DISTRO_NAME, DISTRO_VERSION, and DISTRO_FILE_PREFIX.
			</p>
			<h3>DISTRO_PKGS_SPECS</h3>
			<p>
				This is the file that specifies the packages that your Puppy includes, you can edit this to customize the packages in your Puppy!
				How it's formatted is explained in comments in the file. Other files also have explanatory comments.
			</p>
			<h3>_00build.conf</h3>
			<p>
				This is the file that specifies other settings for the Puppy, including the default theme, the default apps, among other things.
